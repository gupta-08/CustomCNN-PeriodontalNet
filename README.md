# Periodontal Disease Detection
Periodontal disease is a significant concern for global oral health, affecting a substantial portion of the population. Early detection and intervention are crucial to halt its progression and prevent associated complications. Deep Learning methods have emerged as promising tools for medical image analysis, including periodontal disease detection.

In this study, we present an innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) design customized for the diagnosis of periodontal disease. Our  architecture is designed to optimize detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We performed an extensive comparative analysis, assessing our model against classic CNN architectures like VGG16, VGG19, AlexNet, ResNet50 etc. Our analysis covers accuracy metrics, computational performance, and model robustness. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, accurately detecting periodontal disease while remaining computationally efficient. Comparaative analysis with existing models further confirms the consistent outperformance of our proposed system.

This research contributes to advancing automated periodontal disease detection systems, potentially enhancing early diagnosis and treatment planning. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging deep learning techniques in dental imaging analysis and emphasize the significance of developing specialized architectures tailored to specific medical applications.
